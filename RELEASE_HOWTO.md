# Release HOWTO

To release a new version to NPM follow those steps:

## Step 1: Bump the version and tag the commit

From the `master` branch (requires administrative permissions) execute the
following command:

```sh
npm run release
```

Lerna will detect changes in the packages and start an interactive prompt to
select the next version (major, minor or patch).

Upon finish, lerna will **create a version commit and push it directly to
master and tag the release**, e.g. `v0.10.0`.

> Note: Lerna does not update npm `peerDependencies`, so make sure that
> your packages are updated before releasing, for example check
> `packages/react/package.json` for a peer dependency at `@wordsmith/native`

## Step 2: Create a github release

The next step involves creating a Github release. Go to Github releases and
**Draft a new release** by using the tag lerna created:

Tag version: `[v0.10.0]`

Release title: `[v0.10.0]`

Description: `[Details on what changed during this release]`

## Step 3: Automatic publishing using Github actions

When the release is created, a Github action will be automatically triggered
and the packages will be built and deployed to NPM.
